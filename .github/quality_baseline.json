    "This baseline represents acceptable quality and performance targets.",
    "Metrics are measured on synthetic test audio with 44.1kHz sample rate.",
    "RTF (Real-Time Factor): ratio of processing time to audio duration.",
    "Lower RTF and RMSE values indicate better performance/quality.",
    "Higher correlation and similarity values indicate better quality.",
    "Thresholds define maximum acceptable degradation from baseline."
