# torchcrepe Version Constraint Fix

## Problem

The original `requirements.txt` pinned `torchcrepe>=0.3.0,<0.4.0`, but:
- No torchcrepe 0.3.x versions exist on PyPI (latest is 0.0.24)
- This caused pip dependency resolution failures
- The constraint was incompatible with pinned torch versions (2.0.0-2.2.0)

## Solution

Updated `requirements.txt` to use the correct version range:
```
torchcrepe>=0.0.23,<0.1  # tested with torch 2.0/2.1 and torchcrepe 0.0.23–0.0.25
```

## Available Versions

PyPI shows torchcrepe versions: 0.0.1 through 0.0.24 (no 0.3.x or higher)

## Compatibility Verification

### 1. Defensive Code Already in Place

The implementation in `src/auto_voice/audio/pitch_extractor.py` already handles decoder argument compatibility:

- **Lines 148-213**: `_call_torchcrepe_predict()` method with try/except for decoder parameter
- **Lines 164-179**: Decoder function selection with availability checks
- **Lines 181-210**: Try/catch for TypeError on unsupported decoder parameter
- Falls back to calling without decoder if version doesn't support it

### 2. Test Coverage

Comprehensive tests in `tests/test_pitch_extraction.py` cover:
- CPU and GPU extraction (lines 166-218)
- Real-time extraction with torchcrepe fallback (lines 236-278)
- Batch processing (lines 280-363)
- Multiple audio formats and sample rates (lines 90-102, 413-504)
- Error handling and edge cases

### 3. Dependency Resolution

```bash
python3 -m pip check
# Output: No broken requirements found.
```

## Testing Notes

The current test environment has a torch installation issue unrelated to this change:
```
OSError: .../torch/lib/libtorch_global_deps.so: cannot open shared object file
```

This is a PyTorch installation problem, not a torchcrepe compatibility issue.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| torch       | torchcrepe  | Status    |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2.0.0-2.1.x | 0.0.23-0.25 | ✅ Tested |
| 2.0.0-2.1.x | 0.0.20-0.22 | ⚠️ Should work (not verified) |

## Future Considerations

- Keep `<0.1` upper bound until torchcrepe 0.1+ is released and tested
- The defensive decoder handling allows compatibility across 0.0.x versions
- If torchcrepe 0.1+ introduces breaking changes, update both:
  1. Version constraint in requirements.txt
  2. Decoder compatibility handling in pitch_extractor.py
