# Verification Comments Implementation - October 27, 2025

## Summary
All 8 verification comments have been successfully implemented with fixes to the AudioMixer and SingingConversionPipeline classes.

---

## Comment 1: AudioMixer Stereo Format (Channel-First Convention)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `_convert_to_stereo()` in `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py` to return `(2, T)` format instead of `(T, 2)`
- Stack channels along axis 0 for channel-first convention
- Updated all docstrings and comments to reflect `(channels, samples)` convention
- Updated logging to show "(channels, samples)" format

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:533-560` - Updated `_convert_to_stereo()` method
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:262-266` - Updated logging and comments in `mix()` method

---

## Comment 2: convert_vocals_only Audio Loading
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Changed `load_audio()` call to include `return_sr=True` parameter
- Updated unpacking to handle `(vocals, sample_rate)` tuple
- Fixed potential runtime error from unpacking mismatch

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/inference/singing_conversion_pipeline.py:520` - Updated audio loading with proper unpacking

---

## Comment 3: Crossfade Sample Rate Parameter
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Added `sample_rate: int` parameter to `_align_audio_lengths()` method signature
- Pass actual sample rate from caller instead of using config default
- Updated all calls to `_align_audio_lengths()` to pass sample_rate
- Fixed fade calculation to use provided sample rate

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:393-439` - Updated method signature and fade calculation
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:239` - Updated call in `mix()` method
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:324` - Updated call in `mix_with_balance()` method

---

## Comment 4: Volume Multiplier Processing Order
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Reordered processing in `mix()` method:
  1. Initial normalization baseline
  2. Apply target level adjustments
  3. Apply user volume multipliers
  4. Mix tracks
  5. Apply clipping prevention
- This ensures volume multipliers preserve user's intended balance

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:241-268` - Reordered volume processing pipeline

---

## Comment 5: Stereo Dimension Comments Update
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Updated all comments and docstrings to reflect channel-first `(2, T)` convention
- Updated logging messages to clarify "(channels, samples)" format
- API endpoint safeguards remain for backward compatibility

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py` - Updated comments throughout
- Note: API endpoint logic in `src/auto_voice/web/api.py` already handles both formats

---

## Comment 6: Circular Import Fix
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Changed import from `from ..audio.processor import AudioProcessor` to `from .processor import AudioProcessor`
- Both modules are in the same package, so relative import is correct
- Maintains consistency with other package-relative imports

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:25` - Updated import statement

---

## Comment 7: Explicit Mono Reduction Logic
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Implemented explicit channel detection for 2D audio inputs
- Check if dimension 0 or 1 equals 2 to identify channel axis
- Average across detected channel axis
- Fall back to heuristic only for ambiguous shapes
- Applied to both vocals and instrumental in `mix()` method

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/audio/mixer.py:207-231` - Updated mono reduction logic with explicit channel detection

---

## Comment 8: Graceful Pitch Extraction Error Handling
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made:**
- Wrapped pitch extraction in try/except block in `convert_vocals_only()`
- On failure, set `f0_data=None` and `f0_stats={}` and continue
- Use `f0_stats` safely in metadata
- Aligns with error-tolerant flow in `convert_song()` method

**Files Modified:**
- `src/auto_voice/inference/singing_conversion_pipeline.py:528-544` - Added try/except wrapper for pitch extraction

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Stereo Format Tests:**
   - Verify mixer output is `(2, T)` shape
   - Test `torchaudio.save()` with mixer output
   - Verify existing tests pass with channel-first format

2. **Vocals-Only Conversion:**
   - Test `convert_vocals_only()` with valid audio files
   - Verify sample rate is correctly unpacked
   - Test pitch extraction failure handling

3. **Crossfade Alignment:**
   - Test with different sample rates
   - Verify fade calculation uses correct sample rate
   - Test with various audio lengths

4. **Volume Balance:**
   - Test user volume multipliers preserve relative balance
   - Verify vocals at 1.0 and instrumental at 0.5 produces expected mix
   - Test extreme volume values (0.0, 2.0)

5. **Mono Reduction:**
   - Test with `(2, T)` stereo input
   - Test with `(T, 2)` stereo input
   - Test with ambiguous shapes

6. **API Integration:**
   - Test `/convert/song` endpoint with various audio formats
   - Verify stereo output works with API response encoding
   - Test with `return_stems=true`
