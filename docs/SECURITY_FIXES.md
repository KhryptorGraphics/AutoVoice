# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Secret Key Security (CRITICAL)
**File**: `/src/web/app.py`
**Issue**: Hardcoded secret key in production
**Fix**: Added production environment validation
- Now requires SECRET_KEY environment variable in production
- Added warning for development environments
- Prevents deployment with insecure default key

### 2. CORS Configuration (HIGH)
**File**: `/src/auto_voice/web/app.py`
**Issue**: Wildcard CORS origins in production
**Fix**: Environment-configurable CORS origins
- Reads from CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable
- Warns when wildcard is used in production
- Supports comma-separated origin lists

### 3. File Upload Security (HIGH)
**File**: `/src/auto_voice/web/api.py`
**Issue**: Insufficient file validation, path traversal risks
**Fix**: Enhanced file validation
- Added path traversal protection (blocks `..`, `/`, `\`)
- Improved filename validation
- Added secure filename sanitization using `secure_filename()`
- Better error handling for invalid filenames

### 4. CUDA Memory Safety (CRITICAL)
**File**: `/src/cuda_kernels/audio_kernels.cu`
**Issue**: Missing bounds checking, potential buffer overflows
**Fix**: Enhanced memory safety
- Added strict bounds checking in pitch detection kernel
- Improved error handling for memory allocations
- Added proper cleanup on allocation failures
- Enhanced integer overflow protection

## Remaining Security Improvements Needed

### High Priority
1. **Content-Type Validation**: Implement MIME type validation for uploads
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add API request rate limiting
3. **Input Sanitization**: Enhance input validation for all endpoints
4. **Authentication**: Implement proper API authentication

### Medium Priority
1. **Security Headers**: Add HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options headers
2. **Audit Logging**: Implement security event logging
3. **Request Size Limits**: Add per-endpoint size limits
4. **Session Security**: Implement secure session management

## Environment Variables Required

For production deployment, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Required for security
export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-random-secret-key-here"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
export CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com"

# Recommended for monitoring
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export LOG_FORMAT="json"
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before production deployment, ensure:
- [ ] SECRET_KEY is set to a secure random value
- [ ] FLASK_ENV is set to "production"
- [ ] CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS is configured (no wildcards)
- [ ] File upload limits are appropriate
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security scanning is performed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting is configured

## Testing Security Fixes

Test the security fixes with:

```bash
# Test secret key validation
unset SECRET_KEY
export FLASK_ENV=production
python main.py  # Should fail with error

# Test file upload validation
curl -X POST -F 'audio=@../../../etc/passwd' http://localhost:5000/api/process_audio
# Should return error for path traversal attempt

# Test CORS configuration
export CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://allowed.com"
# Test cross-origin requests from unauthorized domains
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement remaining security measures
2. Conduct penetration testing
3. Set up security monitoring
4. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
5. Regular security audits
