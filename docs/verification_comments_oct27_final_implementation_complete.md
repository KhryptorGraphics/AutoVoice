## Comment 1: Device Alignment in forward()

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/singing_voice_converter.py:162-234`

**Implementation**:
- Moved `target_mel.to(device)` immediately after getting model device
- Created or moved `x_mask` to device before any processing
- Ensures both tensors are on the same device as model parameters before calling `posterior_encoder` and `flow_decoder`

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Get model device for consistency
device = next(self.parameters()).device

# Move target_mel and x_mask to model device before processing
target_mel = target_mel.to(device)
if x_mask is not None:
    x_mask = x_mask.to(device)
else:
    x_mask = torch.ones(B, 1, T, device=device)
```

## Comment 2: Batch Size Validation in convert()

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/singing_voice_converter.py:342-356`

**Implementation**:
- Added batch size check after reshaping 2D speaker embeddings
- Validates that `B == 1` (content and pitch are always batch=1 in convert)
- Raises clear `VoiceConversionError` with helpful message if batch size mismatch detected

**Code Changes**:
```python
elif speaker_emb.dim() == 2:
    # Shape [B, speaker_dim]
    B_speaker = speaker_emb.size(0)
    if speaker_emb.size(1) != self.speaker_dim:
        raise VoiceConversionError(...)
    # Check batch size matches content/pitch (which is always 1 for convert)
    if B_speaker != 1:
        raise VoiceConversionError(
            f"convert() supports batch size 1 only. "
            f"target_speaker_embedding has batch size {B_speaker}. "
            f"Please use target_speaker_embedding shape [{self.speaker_dim}] or [1, {self.speaker_dim}]."
        )
```

## Comment 3: Channel to Mono Conversion in extract_content()

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/content_encoder.py:217-233`

**Implementation**:
- After `torchaudio.load(audio)` returns `[C, T]` tensor, average channels to mono
- Applied `audio_tensor.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)` to convert `[C, T]` → `[1, T]`
- Ensures file-based content extraction treats audio as single sample, not batch of channels

**Code Changes**:
```python
if isinstance(audio, str):
    audio_tensor, sr = torchaudio.load(audio)
    sample_rate = sr
    # Average channels to mono: [C, T] -> [1, T]
    audio_tensor = audio_tensor.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True)
```

## Comment 4: Voiced Mask Support

**Status**: ✅ Completed

### Part A: forward() Method

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/singing_voice_converter.py:162-234`

**Implementation**:
- Added `source_voiced: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None` parameter to `forward()`
- Move voiced mask to device if provided
- Pass voiced mask to `PitchEncoder.forward(source_f0, source_voiced)`
- Updated docstring to document the new parameter

**Code Changes**:
```python
def forward(
    self,
    source_audio: torch.Tensor,
    target_mel: torch.Tensor,
    source_f0: torch.Tensor,
    target_speaker_emb: torch.Tensor,
    source_sample_rate: int = 16000,
    x_mask: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None,
    source_voiced: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None  # NEW
) -> Dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    ...
    # Move voiced mask to device if provided
    if source_voiced is not None:
        source_voiced = source_voiced.to(device)

    # Encode pitch with voiced mask
    pitch_emb = self.pitch_encoder(source_f0.to(device), source_voiced)
```

### Part B: convert() Method

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/singing_voice_converter.py:278-305`

**Implementation**:
- When auto-extracting F0, retrieve `voiced = f0_data.get('voiced')`
- Convert to boolean tensor and move to device
- Pass voiced mask to `PitchEncoder.forward(source_f0, source_voiced)`
- Ensure type/device consistency

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Extract F0 if not provided
source_voiced = None
if source_f0 is None:
    from ..audio.pitch_extractor import SingingPitchExtractor
    extractor = SingingPitchExtractor(device=str(device))
    f0_data = extractor.extract_f0_contour(...)
    source_f0 = torch.from_numpy(f0_data['f0']).float().unsqueeze(0)
    # Retrieve voiced mask from pitch extractor
    if 'voiced' in f0_data:
        source_voiced = torch.from_numpy(f0_data['voiced']).bool().unsqueeze(0)
...
if source_voiced is not None:
    source_voiced = source_voiced.to(device)

# Encode pitch with voiced mask
pitch_emb = self.pitch_encoder(source_f0, source_voiced)
```

## Comment 5: Remove Dead f0_bins Buffer

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**File**: `src/auto_voice/models/pitch_encoder.py:49-56`

**Implementation**:
- Removed `self.register_buffer('f0_bins', torch.linspace(f0_min, f0_max, num_bins))` line
- Buffer was unused in forward() - quantization uses normalized indices instead
- Cleaner implementation without dead code

**Code Changes**:
```python
# REMOVED: self.register_buffer('f0_bins', torch.linspace(f0_min, f0_max, num_bins))

# Embedding layer for quantized F0 (+1 for unvoiced/0 Hz)
self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_bins + 1, pitch_dim)
```

## Comment 6: Test Coverage

**Status**: ✅ Completed

**File**: `tests/test_voice_conversion.py:983-1126`

### Test 1: Device Alignment Fix

**Test**: `test_comment6_device_alignment_fix()`

**Coverage**:
- Creates model on CUDA
- Sends `target_mel` on CPU (wrong device)
- Verifies forward() doesn't raise device mismatch error
- Confirms outputs are on CUDA and finite
- Marked with `@pytest.mark.cuda` and skips if CUDA unavailable

**Code**:
```python
@pytest.mark.cuda
def test_comment6_device_alignment_fix(self, cuda_device):
    model = SingingVoiceConverter(config).to('cuda')
    target_mel = torch.randn(1, 80, 50)  # On CPU
    outputs = model(source_audio, target_mel, source_f0, target_speaker_emb)
    assert outputs['pred_mel'].device.type == 'cuda'
```

### Test 2: Voiced Mask Propagation in forward()

**Test**: `test_comment6_voiced_mask_propagation()`

**Coverage**:
- Mocks `PitchEncoder.forward()` to track calls
- Calls model with `source_voiced` parameter
- Asserts `PitchEncoder.forward(f0, voiced)` was called with mask
- Verifies voiced mask matches input

**Code**:
```python
def test_comment6_voiced_mask_propagation(self):
    # Mock PitchEncoder.forward to track calls
    call_args = []
    def mock_forward(f0, voiced=None):
        call_args.append((f0, voiced))
        return original_forward(f0, voiced)

    outputs = model(..., source_voiced=source_voiced)

    assert len(call_args) == 1
    f0_arg, voiced_arg = call_args[0]
    assert voiced_arg is not None
    assert torch.equal(voiced_arg, source_voiced)
```

### Test 3: Voiced Mask in convert()

**Test**: `test_comment6_voiced_mask_in_convert()`

**Coverage**:
- Mocks `PitchEncoder.forward()` to track calls
- Calls `convert()` without F0 (triggers auto-extraction)
- Verifies voiced mask was retrieved from `SingingPitchExtractor`
- Asserts mask is passed to `PitchEncoder.forward()`
- Validates mask is boolean tensor

**Code**:
```python
def test_comment6_voiced_mask_in_convert(self):
    call_args = []
    model.pitch_encoder.forward = mock_forward

    waveform = model.convert(source_audio, target_speaker_emb)

    f0_arg, voiced_arg = call_args[0]
    assert voiced_arg is not None
    assert voiced_arg.dtype == torch.bool
```

- **Comment 2**: Existing single-batch calls work unchanged; only multi-batch (invalid) calls raise errors
- **Comment 3**: Mono conversion is transparent; existing code unaffected
- **Comment 4**: `source_voiced` parameter is optional (defaults to `None`)
- **Comment 5**: Removing unused buffer has no runtime impact
- **Comment 6**: Tests are additive; no existing tests modified

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Checklist
- ✅ All implementations follow instructions verbatim
- ✅ Type hints preserved and extended where needed

- ✅ Device consistency maintained throughout
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing APIs
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage added

### Performance Impact
- ✅ Device alignment adds negligible overhead (single `.to()` call)
- ✅ Batch validation is O(1) check
- ✅ Channel averaging is O(n) but only on file loading path
- ✅ Voiced mask propagation has zero overhead when not provided
- ✅ Removing buffer reduces memory footprint slightly

The codebase is now more robust, maintainable, and production-ready. All changes maintain backward compatibility while improving correctness and reliability.

**Next Steps**:
