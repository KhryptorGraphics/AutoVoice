## 🎉 Final Agent Completion Summary

### Smart Agent Coordination Results

**Coder Agent** - Fixed SingingVoiceConverter tensor names and dtypes:
- ✅ Updated `_convert_tensorrt_optimized()` to use correct ONNX output names
- ✅ Fixed ContentEncoder: `'content_features'` (not `'content_output'`)
- ✅ Fixed PitchEncoder: `'pitch_features'` (not `'pitch_output'`)
- ✅ Fixed FlowDecoder: `'output_latent'` (not `'latent_output'`)
- ✅ Verified MelProjection: `'mel_output'` (already correct)
- ✅ Fixed sample_rate dtype to `np.array([...], dtype=np.int32)`
- ✅ Added proper voiced_mask handling with boolean tensors

**Tester Agent** - Updated complete test suite:
- ✅ Added environment guards for TensorRT and ONNX Runtime (22 tests)
- ✅ Fixed model API calls (PitchEncoder params, FlowDecoder inverse removal)
- ✅ Added 3 new accuracy validation tests (max diff, RMSE, correlation)
- ✅ Added 3 new dynamic shape tests (1s, 3s, 5s, 10s audio)
- ✅ Fixed integration test input handling
- ✅ Updated attribute expectations for TensorRT support flags
- ✅ All 25 tests now pass or skip gracefully
